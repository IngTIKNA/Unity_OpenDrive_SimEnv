# Developing road generator script for creating a simulation environment in Unity based on OpenDRIVE file to simulate vehicle behavior and point cloud data

Game engines can be used for validation of environment simulation, vehicle dynamics, and complex AD algorithms in different scenarios. The goal of this project was to develop a road generator script for creating a simulation environment in Unity3D based on the predefined OpenDRIVE file to simulate vehicle behavior and point-cloud data.


This research work focuses on the development of a road generator script for creating a road structure and corresponding visualization data in driving simulator based on the OpenDRIVE file, which is a standardized file format. The OpenDRIVE files contain a dataset which describes the road structure and covers all the properties regarding a road geometry.

To display the road and its environment in Unity, EasyRoads3D toolset which contains dynamic crossing prefabs and side objects, such as bridges, guard rails, traffic signs is used. 



# OPEN DRIVE – ROAD DESCRIPTION STANDARD 

Because of many companies in automotive industry which need similar dataset for their simulators, such as the description of road network and road objects, several standardized file formats were developed. OpenDRIVE which is one of the standardized file formats’ major examples was developed by VIRES. 

The idea behind creating a file format which contains all properties of road structure was to simplify the exchange of data among different companies and simulators. OpenDRIVE's first public version was released in 2006. Then, this standard has been recognized by a high number of companies.
